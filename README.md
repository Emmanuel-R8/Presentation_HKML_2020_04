- Clone and open the html document with Chromium/Chrome (Firefox bugs on SVG graphics). It can be refreshed under `RStudio` with the Infinite Moonreader addin, or run `xaringan:::inf_mr()`

- The pdf was created `pagedown::chrome_print("HKML_Julia_Xarrigan_2020_04_29.html")`. Unfortunately, the Lorentz attractor goes MIA...
